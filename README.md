# Implementation of the Deep Galerkin Method

The code given here is a companion to the following papers "Tackling Inequality in Economics", "Deep Sannikov".

Note: the basic network stucture is based on "DGM: A deep learning algorithm for solving partial differential equations" by J. Sirignano and K. Spiliopoulos (Journal of Computational Physics, 2018 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07469).

The canonical economic problem is from "A Continuous- Time Version of the Principal: Agent Problem" by Yuily Sannikov (The Review of Economic Studies, Volume 75, Issue 3, July 2008, Pages 957â€“984, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-937X.2008.00486.x)
